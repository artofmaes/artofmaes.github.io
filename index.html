      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="aboutinfo">
        <figure><img src="images/maes25.png" alt="About Jordi"></figure>
        <p>Born in 1996, Jordi has been one of many who were fascinated by the digital world. This goes from television and film to the computer and everything digital. <br><br>
        During his childhood Jordi got a grasp of drawing and went on to draw many things, starting from a simple Sonic figure to in the end his own original creations. <br><br>
        Until the age of 22 Jordi had no idea what the world of programming looked like, nor did he understand it, until one big "EUREKA"-moment made him finally understand. Ever since then he has been hooked on trying to find his way into all sorts of coding languages, with each having their own specific challenges. <br><br>
        Now he's adamant to grow his skills even further to finally head out into the world of adulthood with hopefully many allies on his side, where he can both practice his passion for coding as a job as well as his passions for drawing and teaching kids at Summer Camps on the side.

          <figure><img src="images/drawing.jpg" alt="Rebellion Drawing Concept"></figure>
          <p>I like to draw and recently got a certificate as a Comic Book Author, so I'm now also busy writing my own personal stories which have been lingering in my mind ever since I was 18.</p>

          <h3>Summer Camps @ Oostmalle</h3>
          <figure><img src="images/friends2.jpg" alt="Summer Camps"></figure>
          <p>After making the big move from the kid joining and following the workshops at Summer Camp to the one actually giving the workshops I'm now more than ever passionate about showing the kids of today what I've learned and pass it all on to them.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Hanging out with friends</h3>
          <figure><img src="images/friends.jfif" alt="Friendship"></figure>
          <p>I'm also a person that just LOVES his friends and would do as much as I could to help them out, support them, ... <br>In short, my friends mean everything to me.</p>
