        <p>The Rebellion Saga is a story that has been messing around Jordi's head ever since he had completed his work on War (2014). He wanted to bring the worlds of both animatics he helped create from 2013 and 2014 together and tell one more big and epic story.
        However, this would be taking no less than 6 years in order for this project to finally find its starting point. Having only been working on the climax of the story there had basically been no sort of beginning or middle written whatsoever. <br><br>
        Thanks to the comic book author course Jordi followed at Syntra Brussels he was finally able to find the correct words and story to help give his bigger idea a decent starting point. <br><br>
        Rebellion shall contain four chapters total with an additional prelude "The Golden Plate" going in front of it and will be completed on Jordi's downtime. The entire story has been planned and it's all about the proper execution going from script to end product (being a full-on comic book or maybe even graphic novel). <br> <br>
        Below you can find all previous entries building up towards the project that is Rebellion.

          <h3>Champions (2013)</h3>
          <p>In a world unlike ours, balanced by the four elements, a new leader is chosen when the King dies.
            From the four corners of the known world, four champions are selected and tested in combat, leadership and rightousness.
            Only one of them will be chosen to be the new King of the Realm. <br> <br>
          </p>
          <p>A project that was made back in 2013 as part of a final project for a comic book drawing camp at Oostmalle. This animatic became the root of my own story. Click the image to watch the animatic!</p>

          <h3>War (2014)</h3>
          <p>Reda, 2307. The Capitol was threatened with an attack no one could survive.
          And one day, the Capitol got bombed. the inhabitants shall now have to fight a war they didn't want to have.
          This army will be lead by none other than the Capitol commander himself. It will be up to him to win and to stop this nonsense. <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>What was first planned to be a stand-alone project for a final at a drawing school quickly became part of this new universe when I started work on the sequel merely weeks after this project's release.  Click the image to watch the animatic!</p>

          <h3>The Golden Plate (2020)</h3>
          <p>After the new King has been crowned, a father and his son find out that this new king isn't what they make him out to be. What will they do and how are they going to do it? <br> <br></p>
          <p>The Golden Plate is a midquel that connects Champions (2013) and War (2014) to make a path towards a grander story. <br> <br> </p>
          <p>This project is a four-page mini comic which sets up the basic premise of the Rebellion story which I'm about to tell the world in a matter of time.</p>

          <h3>The Next Chapter...</h3>
          <p>The next chapter (or better said chapters) are currently being written out at my own pace. This past year has been very busy and so I haven't been able to write out all the specifics for ALL these chapters. However, there IS a synopsis ready to go for the first chapter... <br><br></p>
          <p>Rebellion - The Search. The people of Ra-ii have until this day not participated in this huge conflict between the current regime and the Rebellion. Only few know their exact location and now, ten years after the war has begun did both the Regime and the Rebellion gain intel on where it could be.
          On top of that it came to both their attention that the Champion of Air somehow survived and is still alive in said nation. Which side reaches Ra-ii first and who can convince the Champion to join their side? <br><br></p>
          <p>The first chapter of Rebellion should hopefully arrive by the end of 2022.</p>
